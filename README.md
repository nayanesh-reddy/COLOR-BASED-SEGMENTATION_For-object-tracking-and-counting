# COLOR-BASED SEGMENTATION (For object tracking and counting)

In this project a color image in RGB format is segmented based on the selected color using HSV color model. This is achieved by thresholding the H, S and V channels by using the threshold values from an Android app which provides an interactive way to select those values. The segmented image forms a binary mask which is used for further processing (like morphological operations) and by applying connected-components algorithm (CCL) we can find number of objects in the image and can be used for tracking an object of specified color in case of video which is a temporal sequence of images. The tracking is done by drawing the objectâ€™s path using line drawing algorithms and regional properties such as Centroid and Area of regions. 
Finally, I am going to implement a MATLAB code by using which we can draw and fill any closed contours with specific color using the color-based object tracking approach. (like an Augmented Reality (AR) based application that can draw in air)
